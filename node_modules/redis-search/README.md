# redis-search

  redis-search is a very light-weight search engine for node.js using redis. This module is an implementation of [n-gram method](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram). This is a light general purpose search library that could be integrated into a blog, a documentation server, etc.

## Installation

      $ npm install redis-search

## Example

The first thing you'll want to do is create a `Search` instance, which allows you to pass some options, used for namespacing within Redis, size of n-gram, and cache time.
```js
var search = Search.createSearch({
            service : STRING,   // The name of your service. used for namespacing. Default 'search'.
            key : STRING,       // The name of this search. used for namespacing. So that you may have several searches in the same db. Default 'ngram'.
            n : INT,            // The size of n-gram. Note that this method cannot match the word which length shorter then this size. Default '3'.
            cahce_time : INT,   // The second of cache retention. Default '60'.
            client : REDIS CLIENT // The redis client instance. Set if you want customize redis connect. Default connect to local.
        });
```

 redis-ngram acts against arbitrary numeric or string based ids, so you could utilize this library with essentially anything you wish, even combining data stores. The following example just uses an array for our "database", containing some strings, which we add to reds by calling `Search#index()` padding the body of text and an id of some kind, in this case the index.

```js
var strs = [];
strs.push('Foo boo');
strs.push('Foo test');
strs.push('test Boo');
strs.push('test Bar');
strs.forEach(function(str, i){ search.index(str, i); });
```

 To perform a query against reds simply invoke `Search#query()` with a string, and pass a callback, which receives an array of ids when present, or an empty array otherwise.

```js
search
    .query(query = 'test boo', function(err, ids) {
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('Search results for "%s":', query);
        console.log(ids);
        process.exit();
    });
```

 By default performs an intersection of the search words, the previous example would yield the following output:

```
Search results for "test boo":
[ '2', '3', '1', '0' ]
```
 We can set the search type either "and" of "or" (Default) before query.

```js
search
    .type('and')
    .query(query = 'test boo', function(err, ids){
        if (err) throw err;
        console.log('Search results for "%s":', query);
        console.log(ids);
        process.exit();
    });
```
 Output:
```
Search results for "test boo":
[ '2' ]
```

## API

```js
Search.createSearch(opt);
Search#index(text, id[, fn]);
Search#type(and|or);
Search#remove(id[, fn]);
Search#query(text, fn);
```

 Examples:

```js
var Search = require('redis-search');
var search = Search.createSearch('test');
search.index('Foo bar baz', 'abc');
search.index('Foo bar', 'bcd');
search.remove('bcd');
search.query('foo bar', function(err, ids){});
```

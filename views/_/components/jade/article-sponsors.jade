        | The Triangle Computer Science Competition (TCSC) is an initiative that promotes computer science education in secondary schools across the Triangle, an area in central North Carolina boasting approximately 2.5 million people. Drawing inspiration from well-known coding competitions such as “High School Capture the Flag” (HSCTF) and Carnegie Mellon’s picoCTF, the TCSC utilizes intuitive features such as team-oriented virtual classrooms and video-game themed achievement badges to make learning abstract computer science principles enjoyable for students. Participating teams compete for a variety of high tech prizes, such as Apple Developer packages, electronics, and tours of major Triangle tech companies. Winning schools (i.e. those with students who have earned the most points) receive classroom kits that may include new computers, teaching aids, and Raspberry-Pis. Although prizes are exclusive to residents of the Research Triangle, any educator or student across the country is eligible to register.

        | While TCSC was in its incipient stages, the TCSC team emphasized that our main objective was to promote computer science education in our local community by reaching out to underrepresented students in racial, gender, and socioeconomic minority groups. Our team plans to publicize our initiative by contacting the press, schools, and computer science teachers throughout the Triangle area. With enough donations to TCSC, a Kickstarter project could be created with the goal of raising money for small, non-government funded charter schools lacking computer science programs. By encouraging diversity, our goal with TCSC is to promote a learning environment that makes computer science education enjoyable while minimizing demographic disparities in the computer science field.
